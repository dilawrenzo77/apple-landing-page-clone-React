# Apple.com Landing Page Clone REACT
This project is a simple non-responsive frontend clone of the Apple.com landing page, built using React. The goal of this project was to replicate the design and layout of Apple's official website while focusing on designing, clean code, and modern React practices. This is a purely frontend project, meaning no backend functionality is included.


## Features
+ React Components: The page is built using reusable React components for better maintainability and scalability.

+ CSS Styling: Custom CSS is used to replicate the design of the Apple.com landing page

+ No External Libraries: The project does not rely on external UI libraries like Bootstrap or Material-UI, ensuring a lightweight and custom implementation.


## Technologies Used
+ React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

+ HTML5: For structuring the content of the landing page.

+ CSS: For styling and animations.

+ JavaScript (ES6+): For interactivity and dynamic content.

+ Git: For version control and collaboration.
